Java Data Structures Capstone Project: Facebook Social Network Analysis
----------------------------
This repository contains my project code and written report for the Java Data Structures Coursera specialization. In the project, 
I analyze Facebook social network data from the University of California: San Diego. 

Project Information and Data
--------------------------------
All information and data can be obtained from the Capstone project page:

https://www.coursera.org/learn/intermediate-programming-capstone/

Java Files
-----------------
__1. CapGraph:__ The purpose of this java file is to implement the class to read and store the social network data as nodes and edges, and 
to run various algorithms on the graph. 

__2. CapNode:__ A class that stores information about a specific node in the graph. 

__3. CapEdge:__ File implements the CapEdge class which contains information about a connection between 2 specific CapNodes in the graph.


Project Report
--------------

This is the Word document report for the Java Data Structures Capstone project. It details the process I implemented, 
the analyses performed, and the classes and methods implemented to perform my analyses.
